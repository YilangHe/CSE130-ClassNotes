#### Map Pattern 

```haskell
{-do sth to each elem in the list-}
squares [] = []
squares (x:xs) = (x*x) : squares xs

map f [] = []
map f (x:xs) = f x : map f xs

map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
quiz = map (\(x, y) -> x + y) [(1, 2)]

addAdjacent  :: [Int] -> [Int]
```

#### fold-right pattern 

```haskell
--pattern 
{-
	foo op b (x:xs)
	
	   operand -> base case -> list of data
-}

foldr f b [] = b
foldr f b (x:xs) = x `f` (foldr op b xs)

-- recurse on tail
-- combine result with head using some binary operation 

concatList :: [String] -> String 
concatList = foo (++) "" 

concatList ["this", "is", "a", "test"]

{-
foldr op b (x1, x2, x3, x4, x5)
=> op x1 (foldr op b (x2, x3, x4, x5))

=> x1 `op` x2 `op` x3 `op` x4 `op` x5 `op` b
-}

quiz = foldr (\x v -> x : v) [] [1, 2, 3]
```
